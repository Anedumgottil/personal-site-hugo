Ah the two words that excite and [WORD opposite of boring] those who are in their 20s, ____Retierment Investing_. 
Now if you're like me, you'd ask your self why I need to start investing for retierment now or where to even start.

First step is to open a [Roth IRA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roth_IRA), I personally use [Vangaurd](https://investor.vanguard.com/home) to manage the contents of my IRA. 


The American financial theorist and neurologist, William J. Bernstein, has laid out a simple strategy for what assets to invest in his book _"If You Can - How Millennials Can Get Rich Slowly"_ .

If you can : save 15% of your paycheck into your your IRA and distribute it evenly into three categories.
* Category 1 : U.S. Total Stock Market Index Fund.
* Category 2 : International Total Stock Market Index Fund.
* Category 3 : U.S. Total Bond Market Index Fund. 

Once a year check the valuations of these 3 categories and adjust them to be at equal amounts. These will all grow at varius rates so that's why we must adjust the amount once a year. 

You may ask me, "I've been told that Buying low and Selling high is how to make money while investing! Wont my asset value drop?". (Actually check if this is the same thing as Dollar-Cost investing It might not be)

Now there are some hurdles you and I must face when planning for our retierment.
* Control your spending - It's very easy to spend that 15% of your paycheck elsewhere if you do not have tight control over your budget, and lets be honest it's hard to stick to your budget in your 20s. I suggest setting up a transfer through your payroll portal to automatically take out that 15% from each paycheck. If the money isn't directly in your bank account you have less of an attachment to that money. 
* Learn the basics of Finace - 
* Learn the basics of Financial and Market History - Mark Twain once said _"History doesn't repeat itself, but it does ryhme"_. Humans are creatures of habbit, meaning that while we most likely wont make the same exact mistake again, we will probably make a similar mistake as we learn. 
* Learn to plan long term - It's hard panning for the future, [it's just how our brains are wired](https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5530483)! Planning for your retierment is as long term as it gets but dont let that stop you. You might see your assets drop in value in the current short term but since you're reading this I think you're on the right path.  
* Beware of "Free Lunch" - [TBD]
