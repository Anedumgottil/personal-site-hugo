Now more than ever, it's easier and cheaper to host your own personal website. I'll \[list out\] what I used and how I build this site.

## Hugo - Static Site Framework

I'm a huge fan of static sites for most general purpose websites, they load quickly and are easy to maintain. 

I've been using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) as my static site framework since I'm a fan of Go and their [extensive theme library](https://themes.gohugo.io/). 

Hugo has the fastest build time of any static site framework at the time of writing this post, this is really useful for when you need to do more than the average blog post. 

Other notable options out there are [Jekyll]() and [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/).
