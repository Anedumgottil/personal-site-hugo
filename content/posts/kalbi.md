Here's my recipe for LA Kalbi

### Ingredients 
* 2.5 lbs of thinly sliced Beef Short ribs
* 1/2 cup brown sugar
* 1/2 cup dark soy sauce
* 1/4 cup water
* 1/8 cup Sprite 
* 1/8 cup mirin
* 1 tbs seasame oil 
* 1/4 tsp black pepper
* 1/4 tsp white pepper
* Chopped slivers of white onion
* Minced garlic to taste
#### Optional Subisitutions 
* Swap Sprite for Asian Pear or Kiwis

Let marinade for 4-12 hours, the longer the better.
Pat the short ribs dry after marindating and broil on high for 4-6 mins on each side. 

Let it rest and then enjoy.
