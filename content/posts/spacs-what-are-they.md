SPAC?? What the heck is a SPAC and why are they gaining more popularity this year?

SPAC is an acronym for a Special Purpose Acquisition Company, which in laymens terms is publicly traded blank check company with a large cash pile hoping to merge with a private company. 

This is a beneficial move for both parties involved, the SPAC gets an investment in the private company and the private company gets a nice cash infusion and goes public without going though a traditional [IPO](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/ipo.asp "IPO") route.  
  
This all sounds like rainbows and sunshine right?? What could possibly be bad about this?
