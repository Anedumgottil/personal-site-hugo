Here's my recipe for Filipino style BBQ Pork

### Ingredients 
* 4 lbs of boneless Pork Shoulder
* 1/2 cup of Toyomansi 
* 1/2 cup Banana Ketchup
* 1/2 cup of brown sugar
* 8 oz of 7up 
* 1 tsp of minced garlic
* 1 tsp of sesame oil 
* 1 tsp black pepper
* (n) Bamboo skewers

Let marinade for 4-12 hours, the longer the better.

Soak the bamboo skewers in cold water for 30 mins prior to cooking. 

Preheat the oven to 375°F, place the skewered meat on a wire rack and into the oven until the pork's internal temp reaches 145°F.

Broil on high for 4-6 min each side.

Serve with white rice.
