Finally took the plunge and made my own Mechanical Keyboards. I used the following parts:

| Part     | Used                                 |
| -------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Switches | Holy Pandas                          |
| Board    | GK64XS                               |
| KeyCaps  | YMDK Customized 61 64 68 ANSI Keyset |

The Pandas have been the best switches I've used so far, will definitely recommend them.
