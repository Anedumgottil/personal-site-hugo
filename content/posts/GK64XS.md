Finally took the plunge and made my own mechanical keyboard. I used the following parts:

| Part | Used |
| --- | --- |
| Switches | Holy Pandas |
| Board | GK64XS |
| KeyCaps | YMDK Customized 61 64 68 ANSI Keyset |

The Pandas have been the best switches I've used so far, will definitely recommend them.
